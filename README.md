Advent of Code
==============

Here you can find my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

The solutions will be posted once the challenge is finished. Since it's my first year, I probably won't make it all the way to the end. But my intention is trying to solve all challenges at some moment.

Let's go!
